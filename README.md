## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions CI

The workflow file `.github/workflows/simple-ci.yml` defines a basic CI pipeline that runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It performs four labeled steps:

* Build
* Deploy
* S8
* S9

You can view the pipeline in the **Actions** tab after pushing your code or creating a pull request.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Self-hosted Runners

All runner scripts are located in the `runners/` folder. These are Linux-based examples using GitHub-hosted binaries.

### üîß 1. Register an Organization-level Runner

```bash
cd runners
bash org-runner.sh
```

> Replace variables like `ORG` and `<ORG_REGISTRATION_TOKEN>` in the script with your actual values.

---

### üîß 2. Register a Repository-level Runner

```bash
cd runners
bash repo-runner.sh
```

> Replace `REPO`, `OWNER`, and `<REPO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN>` as needed.

---

### ‚ùå 3. Remove a Runner

```bash
cd runners
bash delete-runner.sh  # or >runner.sh
```

> Make sure to replace `<REMOVE_TOKEN>` in the script with a valid removal token.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Notes

* These scripts are intended for Linux environments.
* You must retrieve registration and removal tokens via the GitHub API or web UI.
* Always keep tokens secure. Avoid committing them directly in your scripts.

- `Example-ci-exercises/` contains various `.yml` GitHub Actions workflows for exercises.
- `runners-Scripts/` contains shell scripts to manage self-hosted runners.
- `s9/` and `s10/` are additional modules or sections (contents not shown).
